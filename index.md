A list of Tableau projects from coursework and group projects. Trying out different chart types and filters to see what makes a good visualization or not. Learning from my mistakes and successful attempts.

[SQL Example]

Problem: Working on nested select statements to derive how many 'Alpha Cognac' orders are above average.
<br><br>
Findings: Working with nested select statements is a great way to sub-query. We found which customers were buying more than the average amount of 'Alpha Cognac'. 
<br><br>
Decisions: Profile the customers who are buying more than average amounts of 'Alpha Cognac' and see if there are correlations to season or holiday and if there are any factors we can replicate to increase 'Alpha Cognac' sales in other regions.

Problem: Are there features from the data that can accurately predict if the value of a house will go up or down? 
Model: We were able to create a model that utilized the different features from the data to identify a change in valuation. 
Result: Most of the features did not return significant results and were unreliable. There were a couple of features that produced well enough to prove proof of concept but further work needs to be done. An ML model with training and test data would be preferred. Please utilize the link to look at the code.
